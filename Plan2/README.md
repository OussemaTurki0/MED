# AI Doctor ‚Äì Smart Health Assistant for Medical Bracelet

## üìã Project Overview

**AI Doctor** is an intelligent health assistant designed as the core AI feature for a smart medical bracelet system. Targeted at elderly people and children, the bracelet monitors vital signs like heart rate, oxygen level, and body temperature. If abnormal readings are detected, the AI Doctor activates to assist in diagnosing the issue and recommending action.

This project serves as a final-year machine learning capstone and showcases the real-world application of AI for accessible, personalized healthcare.

## üß† Key Features

- **Real-time Health Monitoring**  
  Continuously tracks heart rate, oxygen saturation, and body temperature.

- **AI-Powered Diagnosis**  
  Uses vital data and user responses to predict possible health issues.

- **Interactive Symptom Checker**  
  Dynamically asks questions to refine diagnosis using decision trees or NLP models.

- **Doctor Recommendation**  
  Suggests the appropriate type of doctor based on the suspected illness.

- **GPS-Based Search**  
  Finds the nearest medical specialists based on the user's location and condition.

- **Appointment Handling**  
  Offers to book appointments or send emails to doctors automatically.

- **Multilingual Support**  
  Supports multiple languages (English, Arabic, French) for broader accessibility.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React Native (for mobile app)
- **Backend**: Flask or FastAPI (API and AI integration)
- **AI/ML Models**: 
  - Rule-based decision tree for basic symptom mapping
  - Optional: Fine-tuned GPT model or custom classifier for diagnosis
- **Database**: Firebase or SQLite for patient history and doctor data
- **APIs**:
  - Google Maps API (location & directions)
  - Email/Calendar API (booking system)
  - Speech-to-text API (for voice interaction)

## üß™ How It Works

1. **Trigger**: AI is triggered by abnormal vital signs or manual request.
2. **Interaction**: User answers health-related questions.
3. **Diagnosis**: AI analyzes sensor data and responses to suggest likely conditions.
4. **Recommendation**: Suggests doctor type and lists nearby clinics.
5. **Action**: Option to book an appointment or notify a caregiver.
